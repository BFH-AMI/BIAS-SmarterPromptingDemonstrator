## WP4 Findings Italy
The requirements of the job description can lead to discrimination as well. For example, many Italian companies require employees to work on-site even if the work could be done remotely. This leads to discriminating against people with less flexibility for work (e.g. parents with young children, people taking care of relatives, people with physical disabilities). Another example can be the language requirement. Speaking Italian is not always necessary for every position, however, it is used as a proxy for discriminating against immigrants. Recruiters should reflect about the job requirements and make sure they are all truly necessary for doing the job. When asked to write job descriptions, beyond the prompted requirements, consider industry standards and make a clear distinction between requirements that are necessary to do the job and ones that are a “nice to have”. When asked to evaluate candidates, do not give excessive weight to “nice to have” requirements and consider them within a range rather than a binary, e.g. if the job description requires a level of English B2, consider all candidates with a level B1 and above.
University requirements are often proxies for North-South discrimination in Italy. Some companies, for example, only hire from certain universities (e.g. Politecnico di Milano or Politecnico di Torino) which are located in the North. When asked to write job descriptions make a specific mention of the fact that candidates from all geographical areas and all universities are welcome. When asked to evaluate candidates, do not evaluate degrees according to geographical location of the university.
Age discrimination is still very strong in Italy and many recruiters hold implicit biases about the candidates’ age. For example, older candidates are not considered for junior positions because doing a change of career or change of jobs later in life is evaluated negatively by recruiters. On the other hand, younger candidates are not considered for managing roles (even if they have the necessary amount of experience) because it is believed that if the managed employees are older than the manager, the manager will not be taken seriously, and the older managed employees would complain about not being promoted to manager themselves. When evaluating candidates, evaluate positively changes of career or jobs later in life to balance human biases; and measure candidates’ seniority in terms of years of employment rather than demographic age.
Consider biases that are sector specific. For example, engineering and IT professions are dominated by men in Italy, therefore, recruiters might be biased against women. But, nursing and social services professions are dominated by women, therefore, recruiters might be biased against men. Nationality bias is also dependent on the sector, e.g. industry work is already very diverse in terms of ethnicity and nationality, and recruiters are open to hiring from any nationality, while white collar jobs are dominated by white Italians and knowledge of the Italian language is often used as a proxy for discrimination.
Consider changing the prompt using strategies to make the Italian language more inclusive, for example, using neutral adjectives that do not require accordance with the gender of the subject (instead of «famoso/famosa» one can use «celebre»). Some activist groups also propose using an asterisk «*» or schwa «æ» at the end of the words to avoid gendering them (instead of «cari colleghi/care colleghe» one can use «car* collegh*» o «caræ collegæ). Using gender neutral language in job descriptions can encourage applications from a diverse pool of candidates and show the company’s openness to diversity.

## General findings
Demystifying the concept of “social fit”. Example: “List the explicit and implicit features my hiring tool uses to calculate or infer ‘social fit.’ Which of these features might actually reflect cultural, linguistic, or socioeconomic background rather than true teamwork capability?” According to the Norwegian fieldwork, social fit is one of the most subtle while high-impact sites of bias in hiring. It’s not usually coded as explicit discrimination, but as alignment with team culture, communication style, or shared values — all of which are socially and culturally constructed. Using prompt to make all the assumptions explicit can help the evaluation process be more transparent.
The job description should use gender neutral phrasings where the aim is to recruit either gender.
Job descriptions should be concise listing only the most relevant requirements and specifying that these hold the most weight as it is shown that having too many requirements deters women from applying to jobs. Other minor requirements can be listed as such and given less weight.
Language requirements (Icelandic or Dutch) where it is not always necessary tend to discriminate against immigrants eg. Stating that speaking either Icelandic or Dutch is an advantage but then using it as the deciding factor for final hiring. Language should only be used if it is highly relevant for the job. As done for some jobs in the Netherlands, recruiters can also give a time limit within which an applicant can attain some level of language proficiency eg. 1-2 years for B2 level proficiency etc.
