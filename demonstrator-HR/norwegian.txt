## General findings
Demystifying the concept of “social fit”. Example: “List the explicit and implicit features my hiring tool uses to calculate or infer ‘social fit.’ Which of these features might actually reflect cultural, linguistic, or socioeconomic background rather than true teamwork capability?” According to the Norwegian fieldwork, social fit is one of the most subtle while high-impact sites of bias in hiring. It’s not usually coded as explicit discrimination, but as alignment with team culture, communication style, or shared values — all of which are socially and culturally constructed. Using prompt to make all the assumptions explicit can help the evaluation process be more transparent.
The job description should use gender neutral phrasings where the aim is to recruit either gender.
Job descriptions should be concise listing only the most relevant requirements and specifying that these hold the most weight as it is shown that having too many requirements deters women from applying to jobs. Other minor requirements can be listed as such and given less weight.
Language requirements (Icelandic or Dutch) where it is not always necessary tend to discriminate against immigrants eg. Stating that speaking either Icelandic or Dutch is an advantage but then using it as the deciding factor for final hiring. Language should only be used if it is highly relevant for the job. As done for some jobs in the Netherlands, recruiters can also give a time limit within which an applicant can attain some level of language proficiency eg. 1-2 years for B2 level proficiency etc.
